The primary goal of the Practicum is to produce a Research Agenda for the eight Visiting Scholars who will participate in the MIT-UTM Malaysia Sustainable Cities Program (MSCP) the following year. The Agenda is meant to help these International Scholars focus their research during the Fall semester they spend in Malaysia. MIT-UTM student-faculty teams meet with public agencies, NGOs, private companies, and community-action groups in Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, Penang, Putrajaya and East Malaysia to identify questions related to sustainable urban development that ought to be the subject of scholarly inquiry. The larger goal is to ensure that the work of the MSCP contributes to improvements in Malaysia as well as to sustainable development efforts throughout the developing world.
