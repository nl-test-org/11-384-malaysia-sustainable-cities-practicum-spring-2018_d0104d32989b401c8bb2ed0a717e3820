Teaching Videos and Working Papers by International Visiting Scholars
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Research Agenda]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/research-agendas) generated each year by the Malaysia Sustainable Cities Practicum is taken up by a cohort of International Visiting Scholars, based in Malaysia for part of the following year, who focus their field research on the suggested topics in the Agenda. Then, while based at MIT for part of the year, the MSCP International Visiting Scholars each produce a short teaching video intended for those teaching about sustainable city development in the developing world and a scholarly paper that appears in the MIT MSCP Working Paper Series.
